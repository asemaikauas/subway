Subway Chaser

**Subway Chaser** is a 2D endless runner inspired by *Subway Surfers*, developed as a course project for **CS-UH 1001 (Intro to Computer Science)**.
The game challenges players to survive as long as possible by dodging obstacles, switching lanes, and collecting coins and power-ups in a fast-paced subway environment.
